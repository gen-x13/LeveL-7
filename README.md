⚠️ Reminder: This is a beginner-level project : a test, an exploration, a digital sketchbook.  
⚠️ Note: This app might take a few seconds to load if it's been inactive — please be patient while it wakes up!
⚠️ Note: The real-time prediction is just an alarm, it's not in any case a real prediction for tsunami.

### **💭 My thoughts on this project:**  
This is my **twelfth project**, and for a beginning, I'm proud of it! 🎉  
- It took me **1 month or less** to build this entirely.

It was a great learning experience, especially for **my problem-solving skills**, my comprehension of **EDA** on that exercise.

💡 My strengths: Determination, self-taught mindset, problem-solving and curiosity.

🚀 Areas for improvement: Code and visualization optimization, and my perfectionnism.

### **💭 Possible Remake of that LEVEL:**  
I’m planning a future remake with:
- Improving the dashboard
- Adding a dahsboard for the Early Warning Page
- And other things, if suggested

"More advanced versions will come soon... Stay tuned."
